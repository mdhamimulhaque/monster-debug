            <h2> What is the difference between Local storage and session storage?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Local storage data inside browser and when you will close your browser it doesn't remove data until
                    clear local storage or change your browser. But Session storage data remove when you will close your
                    open tab. </li>
                <li>Local storage size 5-10 mb .one the other hand, session storage size 5 mb.</li>

            <h2> What is the difference between Global scope and block scope?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Global scope mean i can access its data from anywhere any time.example: if we will declare a
                    variable with var keyword without any function, conditions or any kind of block it will be
                    assessable. On the other hand, if we declare a variable inside any block and we don't have allow to
                    use it's value outside this block it's called block scope. let and const maintain block scope.</li>

            <h2> What is even loop in JavaScript?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript’s asynchronous programming. JS executes all
                    operations on a single thread, but using a few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of
                    multi-threading.
                    The call stack is responsible for keeping track of all the operations in line to be executed.
                    Whenever a function is finished, it is popped from the stack.
                    The event queue is responsible for sending new functions to the stack for processing. It follows the
                    queue data structure to maintain the correct sequence in which all operations should be sent for
                    execution.

            <h2>How many ways we can get undefined?</h2>
            <ol>
                <p>There are several ways to get undefined.</p>
                <li>If we set 2 / 3……parameter but pass 1 value (passing value is not equal to define the total number
                    of parameters)</li>
                <li> If we declare a variable but not set it’s value</li>
                <li>If we use the return key inside the function but do not return any value</li>
                <li>If we want to use function value inside variable but don’t return anything </li>
                <li>If we try to access any object property which is not declared</li>
                <li>When we set any value as undefined</li>
                <li>Inside the array, if we try to find a value which index number is not available</li>
                <li>If we delete any element from an array. (we should not use this. Use splice for this)</li>
            </ol>
