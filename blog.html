            <h2> What is the difference between Global scope and block scope?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Global scope mean i can access its data from anywhere any time.example: if we will declare a
                    variable with var keyword without any function, conditions or any kind of block it will be
                    assessable. On the other hand, if we declare a variable inside any block and we don't have allow to
                    use it's value outside this block it's called block scope. let and const maintain block scope.</li>
